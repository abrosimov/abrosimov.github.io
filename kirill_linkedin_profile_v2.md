## About

I'm a platform engineering leader with 20 years of experience building and scaling developer platforms that power mission-critical services. Most recently, I led the NextGen Platform team at Bumble, where we built a Kubernetes-based PaaS that enabled 100+ services to deploy safely and efficiently.

**What I bring to the table:**
- Deep technical expertise across the full stack - from database optimization to distributed systems
- Proven track record of leading cross-functional teams (5-12 engineers) and driving technical transformation
- Hands-on experience building platforms that reduce deployment time from 30 minutes to 5 minutes
- Strong focus on developer experience, automation, and operational excellence

**Key achievements:**
- Built and scaled UserKV - a high-performance storage system handling 15K RPS with sub-2ms p99 latency
- Led the migration of 100+ services to Kubernetes-based platform with zero major outages
- Reduced social graph processing time from 5 minutes to 20 seconds through algorithm optimization
- Mentored 3 QA engineers in their successful transition to Software Engineering roles

**Technical toolkit:**
- Platform Engineering: Kubernetes, Helm, ArgoCD, Service Mesh, IDP
- Languages: Go, PHP, C/C++, Python
- Databases: MySQL, RocksDB, Cassandra, PostgreSQL
- Observability: Grafana, Prometheus, Distributed Tracing
- Infrastructure: Bare-metal, GCP, CI/CD, Temporal.io

I'm passionate about building platforms that empower developers, solving complex distributed systems challenges, and mentoring the next generation of engineers.

Currently exploring new opportunities in platform engineering, technical leadership, and consulting roles. Based in Dubai, UAE (Golden Visa holder).
